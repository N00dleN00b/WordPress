# Docker Compose Project CYB-3353

The first step I took in my project was installing docker on my laptop. I took the install on Windows route, following this link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/

Then after it was installed, I opened up my Windows Terminal where I followed the WordPress installation guide (linked below).
https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/run-docker-wordpress

The guide starts with

>docker compose version

followed by the version to make sure it was working properly.

Next I create a directory called WordPress and proceed to change directory into that WordPress folder.

Then I opened up VScode where I created my docker-compose.yml file.

Next I typed

>docker compose up -d

in order to get the compose file running. 

Next I opened up a new google tab and typed http://localhost:8000/ 
bringing me to the WordPress browser. 

I created a username and password which gave me access to the WordPress dashboard. 

After that I worked on PHPadmin and successfully installed everything.
